# LEZWIN Cipher
I Created this cipher for fun, it can crypt a text over and over & you can decrypt a crypted text 

it use a random key generated depending on the time & the key is hidden inside the message.

which mean it will give you random text each time you crypt the text which make the cipher `semi-impossible to crack`. 😁

i will add more difficulty to it later or maybe never..
